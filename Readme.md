#python text game project

This is a text-based rpg game Ive been working on for a while.
I have so many more ideas to include in the code but have yet to get to them.

If anyone is willing or able to contribute any ideas/issues you might have for this project I would appreciate it alot. 
If you have any questions about this project at all, I will try my best to answer them.
